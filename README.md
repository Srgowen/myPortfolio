Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository. This website is a showcase of my professional journey, focusing on my expertise in the field of cyber security. It's designed to offer visitors an engaging and informative experience, where they can learn more about my background, skills, and accomplishments.

Website Features
Here are some of the notable features and design elements of the website:

Sleek Design: The website boasts a modern and elegant design. Its color palette and visual elements are thoughtfully chosen to enhance the overall user experience.

Easy Navigation: You can explore the website effortlessly using the navigation menu located in the header. The menu provides quick access to different sections, including "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact."

Interactive Sections: To make the site more engaging, I've implemented a custom JavaScript function that lets you expand or collapse section content. Just click on the section headers to toggle visibility.

Responsive Design: The website is built to adapt seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly display.

CSS Styling
I've paid careful attention to the CSS styling to create a visually appealing and cohesive look and feel for the website. Some key style highlights include:

Font Choices: For readability, I've selected the "Arial" and "sans-serif" font families for the text content.

Background Aesthetics: A captivating background image and color scheme have been carefully chosen to elevate the site's visual appeal.

Header Distinction: The header section stands out with a unique background color, ensuring that the text is easy to read against the backdrop.

Navigation Menu: The navigation menu is designed with horizontal links and a distinct color choice for better visibility.

Styled Button Sections: Sections like "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact" are styled as button sections with a subtle hover effect, enhancing the interactive experience.

JavaScript Function
To bring interactivity to the site, I've included a custom JavaScript function named toggleVisibility. This function allows users to expand or collapse section content by simply clicking on the respective section headers.
