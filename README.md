Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website repository. This website is a showcase of my professional journey, focusing on my expertise in the field of cyber security. It's designed to offer visitors an engaging and informative experience, where they can learn more about my background, skills, and accomplishments.

Website Features
Here are some of the notable features and design elements of the website:

Sleek Design: The website boasts a modern and elegant design. Its color palette and visual elements are thoughtfully chosen to enhance the overall user experience.

Easy Navigation: You can explore the website effortlessly using the navigation menu located in the header. The menu provides quick access to different sections, including "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact."

Interactive Sections: To make the site more engaging, I've implemented a custom JavaScript function that lets you expand or collapse section content. Just click on the section headers to toggle visibility.

Responsive Design: The website is built to adapt seamlessly to various devices and screen sizes, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly display.


I've meticulously crafted the CSS styling to craft an engaging and coherent visual identity for the website. Here are some noteworthy style elements:

Thoughtful Font Selection: To prioritize legibility and user experience, I've deliberately opted for the "Arial" and "sans-serif" font families for all textual content.

Aesthetic Background Choices: I've taken great care in selecting a captivating background image and a harmonious color palette. These choices are intended to enhance the website's overall visual allure.

Distinguished Header: The header section is deliberately designed to command attention. It features a distinctive background color, ensuring that text remains easily readable even against this backdrop.

User-Friendly Navigation: The navigation menu is thoughtfully designed with horizontally arranged links. The choice of a distinct color scheme enhances visibility, making navigation a seamless experience.

Enhanced Button Sections: Sections such as "About," "Portfolio," and "Contact" have been artfully styled as button sections. These sections come to life with a subtle hover effect, contributing to a more engaging and interactive user experience.



JavaScript Function
To bring interactivity to the site, I've included a custom JavaScript function named toggleVisibility. This function allows users to expand or collapse section content by simply clicking on the respective section headers.
